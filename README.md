This Program was made for Games used/bought in the "Microsoft Store".

Why or what do I mean with this, simple:
- Because Minecraft, Roblox, Sea of Thieves and many others in the Microsoft Store, for some reason whilst in Borderless or Fullscreen and running 2 monitors, the mouse cursor won't lock in the current active window.
- So with this I decided to make a program in python and then build it in the VS Code IDE, and release it as an ".EXE".

Yes for free, I don't want any money for this.
