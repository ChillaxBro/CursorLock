Why or what do I mean with this, simple:
- Because Minecraft, Roblox, Sea of Thieves and many others in the Microsoft Store, for some reason whilst in Borderless or Fullscreen and running 2 monitors, the mouse cursor won't lock in the current active window.
- So with this I decided to make a program in python and then build it in the VS Code IDE, and release it as an ".EXE".

- The Default Keybind is "Ctrl+Alt+L" which will lock the cursor.

Usage:
0. Once Running the file, a Windows Notification should pop-up (Since the app speaks with you through Notifications)
1. When screen is in borderless of selected window, press the Keybind.
2. Then it will lock and voil√°.

Reminder:
- When switching the Window from Windowed mode to Borderless/Fullscreen, remember to Unlock and Re-Lock the Cursor.

Conclusion:
- This should remain free forever, since it was made in a Evening through furstration of these big companies not wanting to fix.
